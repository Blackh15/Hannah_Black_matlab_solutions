function [maleIsoIndMeans,femaleIsoIndMeans,maleGroupIsoMean,femaleGroupIsoMean] = genderIsoCalc(variable,X1,X2,X3)

%this code sets up an empty bracket to store results later
maleIsoIndMeans = [];
femaleIsoIndMeans = [];

%this code tells matlab to go through one by one for each subject 
for i= 1:length(variable)
%this code checks to see if the subject is a male and if it is then it puts that data into the maleAverage variable    
if variable (i) == 'M'
%this  code    
maleAverage = (X1(i) + X2(i) + X3(i))/3
maleIsoIndMeans = [maleAverage, maleIsoIndMeans];
else 
femaleAverage = (X1(i) + X2(i) + X3(i))/3
femaleIsoIndMeans = [femaleAverage, femaleIsoIndMeans];
    end 
end 

% this code 
maleGroupIsoMean = sum(maleIsoIndMeans)./(length(maleIsoIndMeans));

femaleGroupIsoMean = sum(femaleIsoIndMeans)./(length(femaleIsoIndMeans));

end
